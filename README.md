# Pandas
Pandas is a Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, as well as tools for cleaning, filtering, and transforming data.
The main data structures in Pandas are the DataFrame and the Series. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional table-like data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, where each column can have a different data type. A Series, on the other hand, is a 1-dimensional array-like data structure, similar to a column in a spreadsheet.

Pandas provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation and analysis, including functions for merging, joining, grouping, pivoting, and reshaping data. It also provides functions for working with missing data, handling time series data, and performing statistical calculations.

Pandas is widely used in data science and machine learning applications, as well as in finance, economics, and other fields where data analysis is important. It is an open source library, and can be installed using pip, the Python package manager.
